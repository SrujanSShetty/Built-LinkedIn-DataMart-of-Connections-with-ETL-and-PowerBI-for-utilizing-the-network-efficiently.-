# Data Warehousing Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design, construction, and deployment of a data warehouse using industry best practices and data modeling methodologies, including the star schema. The project involves extracting, transforming, and loading LinkedIn profiles into a data warehouse, automating data pipelines, and creating a Power BI dashboard for analytics.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Data Extraction and Transformation
- **Objective**: Extract, transform, and load LinkedIn profiles data.
- **Tools Used**: SQL, JSON, ETL Tool.
- **Details**: LinkedIn profiles were extracted and transformed into a structured format for loading into the data warehouse.

### Phase 2: Data Pipeline Development
- **Objective**: Build and automate data pipelines.
- **Tools Used**: ETL Tool, SQL.
- **Details**: Data pipelines were designed and automated. SQL queries were optimized using DDL, DML, DCL, and TCC to enhance performance and manage data integrity.

### Phase 3: Data Visualization
- **Objective**: Create a dashboard to display analytics and decision-making processes.
- **Tools Used**: Power BI.
